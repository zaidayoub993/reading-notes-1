# How you can benefit from a growth mindset

Many of us believe that *intelligence* and *talent* are constant traits, and that success comes only through these qualities 
without the individual needing to develop himself and make an effort, and this is called a **fixed mindset**. A **growth mindset** believes that the individual can develop his fundamental abilities by perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points but 
they always require effort and continuous development, we cannot rely on these features only. A **growth mindset** means love of learning.

#### The differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:
- ***Challenges***: fixed mindest avoids challenges where growth mindest embraces challenges.
- ***Obstacles***: fixed mindest loses focus when faced with obstacles where growth mindest persists.
- ***Effort***: fixed mindest views effort like fruitless where growth mindest believe that no pain no gain.
- ***Criticism***: fixed mindest ignores criticism where growth mindest learns from it.
- ***Success of others***: fixed faced with other's succrss like threat where growth mindest inspired it.

#### Three reminders to myself of how to keep in a growth mindset:
1. When I faced with a challenge I will embrace it as opportunity to grow and learn something new.
2. I will be happy to other's success and learn from their achievements and focus on things I have accomplished to achieve the level of success that I want.
3. When I faced with a criticism I will learn from it and grow my self.
