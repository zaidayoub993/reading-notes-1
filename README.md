# Mastering Markdown 
We use Markdown when we want to style text on the web. Using Markdown enable you to control the display of your document; such as the formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, adding images, creating lists and so on. The md stands for Markdown, you can write a text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *. GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax to provide an additional set features which very useful.

You can write headers using #, you can emphasis the word you want by butting it in **
If you want to add a list, if it is an unordered list use * for each item, if it is ordered list use numbers like 1, 2, 3 for each item, or you can just write number 1 for each item and it will be arranged automatically. To add links but the clickable word in prackets[] and the link you want in parentheses().
